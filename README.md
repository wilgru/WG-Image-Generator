# Image Generation Challenge

## Description
This small web app generates a noise image using unique colours, made from a combination of RGB values. Each RGB value is a combination of values from 0 to 256 with 32 steps per colour channel. In total there are 32,768 colours in the palette for the image generation proces to use,  with no repetion or reuse of colours. 

## Installation
You can clone the repo onto your computer using the following command:

```
git@github.com:wilgru/WG-Image-Generation-Challenge.git
```

As this is a simple web app that is purely front-end, you can get the app running simply by opening the index.html file in your default browser.
